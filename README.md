# Scratch Card App

A Flutter-based mobile application where users can scratch a virtual card every hour to earn coins. These coins can be redeemed for gift cards or discount coupons. The app also maintains a history of all transactions.

---

## Features

1. **Scratch Card**:
   - Scratch a card every hour to earn random coins (between 50 and 500).
   - Visual feedback when the card is scratched.
   - Timer to indicate when the next scratch will be available.

2. **Redemption Store**:
   - Browse a list of gift cards and discount coupons.
   - Redeem coins for items if you have enough balance.

3. **Transaction History**:
   - View a history of all transactions (scratch rewards and redemptions).
   - Each transaction includes a description, timestamp, and points.

4. **State Management**:
   - Uses the **BLoC (Business Logic Component)** pattern for managing app state.

## BLoC Architecture

The app uses the **BLoC pattern** for state management. Here's how it works:

1. **Events**:
   - `ScratchCard`: Triggered when the user scratches the card.
   - `RedeemItem`: Triggered when the user redeems an item from the store.
   - `ResetScratchAvailability`: Triggered when the scratch card becomes available again.

2. **State**:
   - `CoinState`: Holds the current state of the app, including:
     - Coin balance.
     - Scratch card availability.
     - Redemption items.
     - Transaction history.

3. **BLoC**:
   - `CoinBloc`: Handles business logic and emits new states based on events.
